[{"PMID":23749111,"Title":"UV radiation and the skin.","Abstract":"UV radiation (UV) is classified as a \"complete carcinogen\" because it is both a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent and has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.","Authors":"D'Orazio John, Jarrett Stuart, Amaro-Ortiz Alexandra, Scott Timothy","Journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","Year":2013,"Keywords":"Animals, Humans, Melanins, Oxidative Stress, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23749111\/","Affiliations":"Graduate Center for Toxicology and the Departments of Pediatrics, Biomedical and Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, 800 Rose Street, Lexington, KY 40536, USA. jdorazio@uky.edu.","x":6.654027462,"y":10.1431512833,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":38251461,"Title":"Identifying actionable druggable targets for breast cancer: Mendelian randomization and population-based analyses.","Abstract":"Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective approach to address the need for breast cancer prevention and therapeutics. We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR) and then validate the candidate drugs using population-based analyses. We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls). We further conducted a nested case-control study using data retrieved from Swedish registers to validate the candidate drugs that were identified from MR analyses. We identified six significant MR associations with gene expression levels (TUBB, MDM2, CSK, ULK3, MC1R and KCNN4) and two significant associations with gene methylation levels across 21 CpG islands (RPS23 and MAPT). Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.51-0.83). However, usage of estradiol, tolterodine, and nitrofurantoin (also targeting MAPT) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs and 95% CI of 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.16 (1.09-1.24), and 1.09 (1.05-1.13), respectively. The effect of raloxifene and nitrofurantoin lost significance in further validation analyses using active-comparator and new-user design. This large-scale MR analysis, combined with population-based validation, identified eight druggable target genes for breast cancer and suggested that raloxifene is an effective chemoprevention against breast cancer.

Epidemiological studies identified genetically determined phenotypes such as pale skin, freckles and red hair, and sunburn as risk factors for this cancer. The development of many melanocytic naevi is also genetically determined and a strong melanoma risk phenotype. Not surprisingly then, genome wide association studies have identified pigmentation genes as common risk genes, and to a lesser extent, genes associated with melanocytic naevi. More unexpectedly, genes associated with telomere length have also been identified as risk genes. Higher risk susceptibility genes have been identified, particularly CDKN2A as the most common cause, and very rarely genes such as CDK4, POT1, TERT and other genes in coding for proteins in the shelterin complex are found to be mutated. Familial melanoma genes are associated with an increased number of melanocytic naevi but not invariably and the atypical naevus phenotype is therefore an imperfect marker of gene carrier status. At a somatic level, the most common driver mutation is BRAF, second most common NRAS, third NF1 and increasing numbers of additional rarer mutations are being identified such as in TP53.

Its paracrine stimulation by keratinocyte-derived melanocortins also activates DNA repair pathways and antioxidant defenses to build a complex, multifaceted photoprotective response.

A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. The gene encodes a receptor for melanocortins. These substances stimulate melanocytes to product melanin- a dye of the skin which is transported to keratinocytes. It protects a cellular nucleus from ultraviolet radiation. Melanin has two types: eumelanin which is dark brown or even black and red\/orange pheomelanin. The second one is mostly observed in red-headed which is caused by R allele. The DNA damage occurs more easily because of worse protecting ability of pheomelanin. Moreover this allele is connected with inefficient DNA repair. People with R allele have not only flaming red hairstyle but also very fair skin (often with freckles) and blue eyes. Unfortunately this phenotype is more exposed to harmful effects of UV rays. It means that too extensive exposition to solar light leads to sunburn and development of cancerous skin diseases with melanoma as the worst. R allele is a recessive variant of the gene so only in homozygous persons this characteristic phenotype is observed. Nevertheless blond- or auburn-haired carriers of this allele are also more prone to develop carcinomas. The red-headed also differ from the others in sensitivity to anaesthetics, what is shown by increased MAC. On the other hand these persons less often suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, also termed variants) in MC1R frequently cause red hair, fair skin and are associated with melanoma and keratinocyte-derived skin cancer development. Activation of wild-type (WT) MC1R in skin assists cutaneous photoprotection whereas reduced MC1R signalling, seen with MC1R variants, impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-protective responses. As ancestral humans migrated out of Africa, the evolutionary advantage of MC1R variants may have related to improved cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and higher birthweight reported with certain MC1R variants. Reduced photoprotection secondary to MC1R dysfunction involves pigmentary and non-pigmentary mechanisms (reduced DNA repair, effects on cell proliferation and possibly immunological parameters), leading to clonal expansion of mutated cells within skin and subsequent carcinogenesis. Recent investigations suggest an association between MC1R genotype and vitiligo, with preliminary evidence that a MC1R agonist, [Nle4-D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH, in combination with UVB, assists repigmentation.

Variant allele frequencies have also been determined in several case-control studies of sporadic melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and in familial melanoma kindreds collected within Australia. These studies have shown that three RHC alleles - Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp and Asp294His - were associated with increased risk in all forms of skin cancer and with penetrance and age of onset in familial melanoma in mutation carriers. There is a significant RHC allele heterozygote carrier effect on skin phototype and skin cancer risk, which indicates that variant alleles do not behave in a strictly recessive manner. Ultimately, the genetic and chemical assessment of melanin synthesis rather than skin colour will be the best indicator for skin cancer risk, and such genetic association studies combined with functional analysis of variant alleles should provide the link to understanding skin phototypes.","Authors":"Sturm R A","Journal":"Melanoma research","Year":2002,"Keywords":"Alleles, Amino Acid Sequence, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Base Sequence, Case-Control Studies, Cystine, Genotype, Histidine, Humans, Models, Genetic, Molecular Sequence Data, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Signal Transduction, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Tryptophan, Twins, Twins, Dizygotic, Twins, Monozygotic, Ultraviolet Rays","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/12394181\/","Affiliations":"Institute for Moleular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

MC1R activation after ultraviolet radiation exposure results in the production of the dark eumelanin pigment and the tanning process in humans, providing physical protection against DNA damage. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic in Caucasian populations with a number of MC1R variant alleles associated with red hair, fair skin, freckling, poor tanning, and increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Variant receptors have shown alterations in biochemical function, largely due to intracellular retention or impaired G-protein coupling, but retain some signaling ability. The association of MC1R variant alleles with skin cancer risk remains after correction for pigmentation phenotype, indicating regulation of nonpigmentary pathways. Notably, MC1R activation has been linked to DNA repair and may also contribute to the regulation of immune responses.","Authors":"Beaumont Kimberley A, Liu Yan Yan, Sturm Richard A","Journal":"Progress in molecular biology and translational science","Year":2009,"Keywords":"Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Phenotype, Pigmentation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/20374726\/","Affiliations":"Melanogenix Group, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","x":5.512275219,"y":9.1796197891,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":34924555,"Title":"Genome-wide association study of pain sensitivity assessed by questionnaire and the cold pressor test.","Abstract":"We deployed an online pain sensitivity questionnaire (PSQ) and an at-home version of the cold pressor test (CPT) in a large genotyped cohort.

Differences in the degree of pain stimulation and pain sensitivity, weight and age differences, prior opioid use and tolerance, as well as the differences in bioavailability of various opioid formulations have been cited as causes for the wide variability in analgesia seen with opioids. Genetics may explain the variability of responses and help to predict more effective (or less dangerous) medication choices and doses. Genetics may also help to predict the response to specific opioids and antidepressants. In this review article, we discuss the genetic influence of nociception, analgesia, and hyoanalgesia. The CYP450 enzymes involved in the metabolism and activity of opioids and adjuvant analgesics are genetically controlled, as are the opioid receptors and a variety of brain chemistries. This article discusses the specific pain implications of genetic variations in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, OPRM1, OPRK1, OPRD1, COMT, GABA, UGT, MC1R, GCH1, ABCB1, P-glycoprotein, 5HTR1A, 5HTR2A, MTHFR, CACNA2D2, and 5-HTTLPR. Recent research findings suggest the relationship between genetic predisposition and clinical behavior, including the risk of opioid misuse and addiction. While urine drug testing may hint at genetic issues regarding opioid metabolism, cheek swab DNA testing has become economically viable, and we review the current and future genetic pain issues that may influence the decisions that pain clinicians make every day. Genetic testing may explain and predict many of the clinical responses seen with opioids and adjuvant medications, and may help the clinician identify those patients at genetic risk of opioid misuse and addiction.","Authors":"Trescot Andrea M, Faynboym Semyon","Journal":"Pain physician","Year":2014,"Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid, Genetic Testing, Humans, Opioid-Related Disorders, Pain, Pain Management","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25247900\/","Affiliations":"Pain and Headache Center, Wasilla, AK; Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.","x":3.5873975754,"y":7.3380236626,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":31834199,"Title":"Detangling red hair from pain: phenotype-specific contributions from different genetic variants in melanocortin-1 receptor.","Abstract":"Genetic variation in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has a known role in red hair.

Among white children, those with the palest complexions suffer the most damage. Comparisons of prevalence and incidence of outcomes in children and teenagers sharing common ancestry, but living at different latitudes, show that prevalence rates of photoaging and melanocytic naevi are higher in Australian compared with British children, and similarly for melanoma. Genetic risk for the majority of the melanomas in teens is a function of genes controlling naevus propensity and pigmentation in the skin. High numbers of naevi and freckles, red hair, blue eyes, inability to tan, as well as a family history are the primary determinants of melanoma among adolescents. Beyond the signs of skin damage seen in children are the latent effects observed later in adulthood. Childhood is believed to be a susceptible window for long-term harmful effects of UV, as evidenced by clear differences in skin cancer risk between child and adult migrants from high to low latitudes.

The variations in skin pigmentation are dependent on geographic location and population ethnicity. Skin colouration is mainly due to the pigmentation substance melanin, produced in specialized organelles (melanosomes) within dendritic melanocytes, and transferred to neighbouring keratinocytes. The two types of melanin synthesized in well defined chemical reactions are the protective dark coloured eumelanin and the sulphur containing light red-yellow pheomelanin. The events leading to the synthesis of melanin are controlled by signalling cascades that involve a host of genes encoding ligands, receptors, transcription factors, channel transporters and many other crucial molecules. Several variants within the genes involved in pigmentation have been associated with high risk phenotypes like fair skin, brown-red hair and green-blue eyes. Many of those variants have also been implicated in the risk of various skin cancers. The variants within the key pigmentation gene, melanocortin-receptor 1 (MC1R), in particular have been ubiquitously linked with high risk traits and skin cancers involving both pigmentary and non-pigmentary functions and likely interaction with variants in other genes. Many of the variants in other genes, functional in pigmentation pathway, have also been associated with phenotypic variation and risk of skin cancers. Those genes include agouti signalling protein (ASIP), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), various solute carrier genes and transporters. Most of those associations have been confirmed in genome wide association studies that at the same time have also identified new loci involved in phenotypic variation and skin cancer risk. In conclusion, the genetic variants within the genes involved in skin pigmentation besides influencing phenotypic traits are important determinants of risk of several skin cancers. However, ultimate risk of skin cancer is dependent on interplay between genetic and host factors.","Authors":"Scherer Dominique, Kumar Rajiv","Journal":"Mutation research","Year":2010,"Keywords":"Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk, Signal Transduction, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/20601102\/","Affiliations":"Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

Several MC1R variant alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk. We have performed a systematic functional analysis of nine common MC1R variants and correlated these results with the strength of the genetic association of each variant allele with pigmentation phenotypes. In vitro expression studies revealed that variant receptors with reduced cell surface expression, including V60L, D84E, R151C, I155T, R160W and R163Q, showed a corresponding impairment in cAMP coupling. The R142H and D294H variants demonstrated normal cell surface expression, but had reduced functional responses, indicating that altered G-protein coupling may be responsible for this loss of function. The V92M variant cAMP activation was equal to or higher than that for wild-type MC1R. In co-expression studies, the D84E, R151C, I155T and R160W variants showed a dominant negative effect on wild-type receptor cell surface expression, which was reflected in a decreased ability to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. The D294H variant also demonstrated a dominant negative effect on wild-type MC1R cAMP signalling, but had no effect on wild-type surface expression. Importantly, comparison of the in vitro receptor characteristics with skin and hair colour data of individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MC1R variant alleles revealed parallels between variant MC1R cell surface expression, functional ability, dominant negative activity and their effects on human pigmentation.

The underlying mechanisms by which the MC1R defends against UV-induced skin cancer are not known. We used neonatal mouse skin (which, like human skin, contains a mixture of melanocytes and keratinocytes) to study how pigment cells and Mc1r genotype affect the genome-level response to UV radiation. Animals without viable melanocytes (Kit(W-v)\/Kit(W-v)) or animals lacking a functional Mc1r (Mc1r(e)\/Mc1r(e)) were exposed to sunburn-level doses of UVB radiation, and the patterns of large-scale gene expression in the basal epidermis were compared to each other and to nonmutant animals. Our analysis revealed discrete Kit- and Mc1r-dependent UVB transcriptional responses in the basal epidermis. The Kit-dependent UVB response was characterized largely by an enrichment of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes, highlighting a distinctive role for pigmented melanocytes in mediating antioxidant defenses against genotoxic stresses within the basal epidermal environment. By contrast, the Mc1r-dependent UVB response contained an abundance of genes associated with regulating the cell cycle and oncogenesis. To test the clinical relevance of these observations, we analyzed publicly available data sets for primary melanoma and melanoma metastases and found that the set of genes specific for the Mc1r-dependent UVB response was able to differentiate between different clinical subtypes. Our analysis also revealed that the classes of genes induced by UVB differ from those repressed by UVB with regard to their biological functions, their overall number, and their size. The findings described here offer new insights into the transcriptional nature of the UV response in the skin and provide a molecular framework for the underlying mechanisms by which melanocytes and the Mc1r independently mediate and afford protection against UV radiation.","Authors":"April Craig S, Barsh Gregory S","Journal":"PLoS genetics","Year":2007,"Keywords":"Animals, Cell Cycle, Cluster Analysis, Epidermis, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Neoplasm, Genotype, Humans, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Models, Genetic, Pigmentation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Reproducibility of Results, Signal Transduction, Skin, Transcription, Genetic, Ultraviolet Rays","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17222061\/","Affiliations":"Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.","x":6.0748820305,"y":10.7852783203,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":32350296,"Title":"MC1R variants and associations with pigmentation characteristics and genetic ancestry in a Hispanic, predominately Puerto Rican, population.","Abstract":"Skin cancer risk information based on melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants could inform prevention and screening recommendations for Hispanics, but limited evidence exists on the impact of MC1R variants in Hispanic populations.

Several genetic variants prevent or at least decrease pain in their carriers as compared with carriers of the respective wild-type or common alleles by impeding the generation, transmission and processing of nociceptive information or by increasing the local availability of active analgesics or their pharmacodynamic effects. Complete prevention of pain has so far been seen in six distinct rare hereditary syndromes, namely the 'channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain', caused by 13 currently identified variants in the SCN9A gene coding for the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, and five maladies belonging to the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) I-V syndromes, caused by various mutations in several genes. Reduced pain in the average population has been associated with frequent variants in the micro-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT), guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1\/dopa-responsive dystonia gene (GCH1), transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 gene (TRPV1) or the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Duplications\/amplifications of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene leading to increased enzyme function may cause intense opioid effects of codeine up to toxicity. The COMT V158M variant has been associated with decreased morphine requirements for analgesia. Inactivating MC1R variants have been associated with increased opioid analgesia of the micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine-6-glucuronide and, in women only, of kappa-opioid agonists. Finally, variants in the P-glycoprotein gene (ABCB1) conferring decreased transporter function have been associated with increased respiratory depressive effects of fentanyl. In summary, a finite number of genetic variants that prevent pain by decreasing nociception or increasing analgesia have been identified. Given the complex biological and psychological nature of pain, we will see in the near future how much of the interindividual variance in pain and analgesia is due to identifiable genetic causes, and to what extent genetics enters clinical pain therapy.","Authors":"Oertel Bruno, L\u00f6tsch J\u00f6rn","Journal":"Pharmacogenomics","Year":2008,"Keywords":"Analgesics, Animals, Genetic Variation, Humans, Mutation, Pain","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/18370847\/","Affiliations":"Pharmazentrum Frankfurt\/ZAFES, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.","x":3.7507412434,"y":7.2094378471,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":12006619,"Title":"Human melanocortin 1 receptor variants, receptor function and melanocyte response to UV radiation.","Abstract":"Cutaneous pigmentation is determined by the amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesized by epidermal melanocytes and is known to protect against sun-induced DNA damage. The synthesis of eumelanin is stimulated by the binding of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) to the functional melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on melanocytes. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The importance of the MC1R gene in determining skin cancer risk led us to examine the impact of specific polymorphisms in this gene on the responses of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin and UV radiation. We compared the ability of human melanocyte cultures, each derived from a single donor, to respond to alpha-melanotropin with dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP formation, tyrosinase activity and proliferation. In each of those cultures the MC1R gene was sequenced, and the eumelanin and pheomelanin contents were determined. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His, or for Arg151Cys and Asp294His substitutions, but not melanocytes homozygous for Val92Met substitution, in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-melanotropin. Additionally, melanocytes with a non-functional MC1R demonstrated a pronounced increase in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation compared with melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R gene sensitize human melanocytes to the DNA damaging effects of UV radiation, which may increase skin cancer risk.","Authors":"Scott M Cathy, Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Ito Shosuke, Kadekaro Ana Luisa, Kobayashi Nobuhiko, Groden Joanna, Kavanagh Renny, Takakuwa Takako, Virador Victoria, Hearing Vincent J, Abdel-Malek Zalfa A","Journal":"Journal of cell science","Year":2002,"Keywords":"Cell Death, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cells, Cultured, Cyclic AMP, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epidermis, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Male, Melanins, Melanocytes, Monophenol Monooxygenase, Mutation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays, alpha-MSH","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/12006619\/","Affiliations":"Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, PO Box 670592, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0592, USA.","x":5.613825798,"y":10.1627855301,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":29284020,"Title":"Health status by gender, hair color, and eye color: Red-haired women are the most divergent.","Abstract":"Red hair is associated in women with pain sensitivity.

We tested this hypothesis by questioning a large sample of Czech and Slovak respondents about the natural redness and darkness of their hair, their natural eye color, their physical and mental health (24 categories), and other personal attributes (height, weight, number of children, lifelong number of sexual partners, frequency of smoking). Red-haired women did worse than other women in ten health categories and better in only three, being particularly prone to colorectal, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer.

We also confirmed earlier findings that red hair is naturally more frequent in women than in men. Of the 'new' hair and eye colors, red hair diverges the most from the ancestral state of black hair and brown eyes, being the most sexually dimorphic variant not only in population frequency but also in health status. This divergent health status may have one or more causes: direct effects of red hair pigments (pheomelanins) or their by-products; effects of other genes that show linkage with genes involved in pheomelanin production; excessive prenatal exposure to estrogen (which facilitates expression of red hair during fetal development and which, at high levels, may cause health problems later in life); evolutionary recentness of red hair and corresponding lack of time to correct negative side effects; or genetic incompatibilities associated with the allele Val92Met, which seems to be of Neanderthal origin and is one of the alleles that can cause red hair.","Authors":"Frost Peter, Kleisner Karel, Flegr Jaroslav","Journal":"PloS one","Year":2017,"Keywords":"Czech Republic, Eye Color, Female, Hair Color, Health Status, Humans, Male, Sex Factors, Slovakia","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29284020\/","Affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec City, Canada.; Division of Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Vini\u010dn\u00e1 7, Czech Republic.","x":5.1547293663,"y":7.0108213425,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":16417234,"Title":"Dimerization of the human melanocortin 1 receptor: functional consequences and dominant-negative effects.","Abstract":"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a G(S)-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation of epidermal melanocytes, and a determinant of human skin phototype and cancer risk.

SDS-PAGE analysis of melanoma cells and heterologous cells expressing epitope-tagged MC1R revealed dimeric and oligomeric species in detergent-solubilized extracts, confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged MC1R forms.

Furthermore, primary human melanocytes harboring homozygous RHC variant MC1R alleles exhibited an impaired induction of NR4A genes in response to the potent MC1R agonist (Nle4,D-Phe7)-alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Using small interference RNA-mediated attenuation of NR4A1 and NR4A2 expression in melanocytes, the ability to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers following UV irradiation appeared to be impaired in the context of MC1R signaling.

In contrast, redheads were more sensitive to cold pain perception (22.6 [15.1-26.1] vs. 12.6 [0-20] degrees C; P = 0.004), cold pain tolerance (6.0 [0-9.7] vs. 0.0 [0.0-2.0] degrees C; P = 0.001), and heat pain (46.3 [45.7-47.5] vs. 47.7 [46.6-48.7] degrees C; P = 0.009). Subcutaneous lidocaine was significantly less effective in redheads (e.g., pain tolerance threshold at 2,000-Hz stimulation in redheads was 11.0 [8.5-16.5] vs. > 20.0 (14.5 to > 20) mA in others; P = 0.005). Red hair is the phenotype for mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor. Results indicate that redheads are more sensitive to thermal pain and are resistant to the analgesic effects of subcutaneous lidocaine. Mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor, or a consequence thereof, thus modulate pain sensitivity.","Authors":"Liem Edwin B, Joiner Teresa V, Tsueda Kentaro, Sessler Daniel I","Journal":"Anesthesiology","Year":2005,"Keywords":"Adult, Anesthetics, Local, Female, Hair Color, Hot Temperature, Humans, Lidocaine, Mutation, Pain Threshold, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15731586\/","Affiliations":"Outcomes Research Institute and Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.","x":4.6070914268,"y":6.9884977341,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":21084381,"Title":"Signaling from the human melanocortin 1 receptor to ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases involves transactivation of cKIT.","Abstract":"Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor expressed in melanocytes, is a major determinant of skin pigmentation, phototype and cancer risk. Upon stimulation by \u03b1MSH, MC1R triggers the cAMP and ERK1\/ERK2 MAPK pathways. In mouse melanocytes, ERK activation by \u03b1MSH binding to Mc1r depends on cAMP, and melanocytes are considered a paradigm for cAMP-dependent ERK activation. However, human MC1R variants associated with red hair, fair skin [red hair color (RHC) phenotype], and increased skin cancer risk display reduced cAMP signaling but activate ERKs as efficiently as wild type in heterologous cells, suggesting independent signaling to ERKs and cAMP in human melanocytes. We show that MC1R signaling activated the ERK pathway in normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells expressing physiological levels of endogenous RHC variants. ERK activation was comparable for wild-type and mutant MC1R and was independent on cAMP because it was neither triggered by stimulation of cAMP synthesis with forskolin nor blocked by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. Stimulation of MC1R with \u03b1MSH did not lead to protein kinase C activation and ERK activation was unaffected by protein kinase C inhibitors. Conversely, pharmacological interference, small interfering RNA studies, expression profiles, and functional reconstitution experiments showed that \u03b1MSH-induced ERK activation resulted from Src tyrosine kinase-mediated transactivation of the stem cell factor receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for proliferation, differentiation, and survival of melanocyte precursors, thus demonstrating a functional link between the stem cell factor receptor and MC1R. Moreover, this transactivation phenomenon is unique because it is unaffected by natural mutations impairing canonical MC1R signaling through the cAMP pathway.","Authors":"Herraiz Cecilia, Journ\u00e9 Fabrice, Abdel-Malek Zalfa, Ghanem Ghanem, Jim\u00e9nez-Cervantes Celia, Garc\u00eda-Borr\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 C","Journal":"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)","Year":2011,"Keywords":"Animals, Cell Line, Tumor, Cyclic AMP, Enzyme Activation, HEK293 Cells, Humans, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Melanocortins, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3, PC12 Cells, Phosphorylation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Rats, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Signal Transduction, Transcriptional Activation, alpha-MSH, src-Family Kinases","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21084381\/","Affiliations":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, 30100 Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.","x":4.3267035484,"y":9.5955142975,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":23828250,"Title":"Basal-cell carcinoma incidence and associated risk factors in U.S. women and men.","Abstract":"There is a paucity of data on basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) in the United States, since most national registries do not collect information on BCC.

Participants were registered clinic patients (\u22656 months) and English or Spanish fluent. Of the 600 participants recruited to the overall trial, the present study included those 499 participants randomized to the MC1R test offer. Participants were presented with the option to log onto the study website to read 3 educational modules presenting the rationale, benefits, and drawbacks of MC1R testing. Main outcomes include website log on (yes vs no), saliva test kit request (yes vs no), and saliva test kit return for MC1R testing (yes vs no).

About 95% of ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) and 5% of UVB (280-320 nm) reach the Earth's surface. Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 \u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF). The BRAF gene mutations were observed in ~50% of CMM cases. Mutations of P53 gene are not characteristic of CMM cells.

Cancer fatalism is important in cancer prevention and deserves theoretical and empirical attention in the context of genomics and behavior change. The current study employed data from a randomized controlled trial (N\u00a0=\u00a0593) offering skin cancer genetic testing (using the melanocortin-1 receptor [MC1R] gene) in primary care in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. We examined interrelations of cancer fatalism with demographics, general health beliefs, perceived risk, perceived control, sun protection and skin screening behaviors and cancer worry in the skin cancer context stratified across Hispanic versus non-Hispanic ethnicity, and examined cancer fatalism as a moderator of intervention effects on study primary outcomes, including 3-month sun protection, cancer worry and perceived risk. Cancer fatalism was significantly related to the perception of control over skin cancer risk behaviors (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) and demographics (ethnicity, education, health literacy; ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not consistently related to general health beliefs or risk perception. Cancer fatalism did not moderate intervention effects on primary outcomes, except those with higher cancer fatalism randomized to intervention had higher levels of 3-month cancer worry (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). These findings will guide future work considering the role of cancer fatalism in use of genomic technologies in the general population. This work anticipates strategies required to address cancer fatalism as translational genomics becomes more commonly available to diverse general population subgroups.","Authors":"Hay Jennifer L, Wu Yelena, Schofield Elizabeth, Kaphingst Kim, Sussman Andrew L, Guest Delores D, Hunley Keith, Li Yuelin, Buller David, Berwick Marianne","Journal":"Psycho-oncology","Year":2024,"Keywords":"Humans, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Skin Neoplasms, Hispanic or Latino, Genetic Testing, Primary Health Care","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38546209\/","Affiliations":"Cancer Communication Research, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Klein Buendel, Inc., Golden, Colorado, USA.; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.","x":7.3457474709,"y":6.7865200043,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":15994880,"Title":"Melanocortin-1 receptor gene variants affect pain and mu-opioid analgesia in mice and humans.","Abstract":"A recent genetic study in mice and humans revealed the modulatory effect of MC1R (melanocortin-1 receptor) gene variants on kappa-opioid receptor mediated analgesia.

MC1R is one of the major genes that determine skin pigmentation because the melanocortin-1 receptor regulates eumelanin synthesis. GSTT1 and GSTM1 are enzymes expressed in the skin that detoxify products of oxidative stress reactions caused by UV irradiation. In this study variations in the MC1R, GSTM1 and T1 genes were analyzed in 347 healthy subjects and 322 patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma by direct cycle sequencing, RFLP and multiplex PCR.

Nevertheless, the selective interactions between UV exposures and nevus and freckling genes remain largely undescribed.

MC1R and HERC2\/OCA2 rs12913832 were genotyped and linear mixed models were used to identify main and interaction effects. All measures of sun exposure (chronic, sunburns, and waterside vacations) contributed to total nevus counts, and cumulative chronic exposure acted as the major driver of nevus development. Waterside vacations strongly increased total nevus counts in children with rs12913832 blue eye color alleles and facial freckling scores in those with MC1R red hair color variants. Sunburns increased the numbers of larger nevi (\u22652 mm) in subjects with certain MC1R and rs12913832 genotypes. Complex interactions between different UV exposure profiles and genotype combinations determine nevus numbers and size, and the degree of facial freckling.

Penetrance of CDKN2A mutations is modified by pigmentation characteristics, nevus phenotypes, and some variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R), which is known to have a role in the pigmentation process. However, investigation of the associations of both MC1R variants and host phenotypes with melanoma risk has been limited. We included 815 CDKN2A mutation carriers (473 affected, and 342 unaffected, with melanoma) from 186 families from 15 centers in Europe, North America, and Australia who participated in the Melanoma Genetics Consortium. In this family-based study, we assessed the associations of the four most frequent MC1R variants (V60L, V92M, R151C, and R160W) and the number of variants (1, \u22652 variants), alone or jointly with the host phenotypes (hair color, propensity to sunburn, and number of nevi), with melanoma risk in CDKN2A mutation carriers. These associations were estimated and tested using generalized estimating equations. All statistical tests were two-sided. Carrying any one of the four most frequent MC1R variants (V60L, V92M, R151C, R160W) in CDKN2A mutation carriers was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk for melanoma across all continents (1.24 \u00d7 10(-6) \u2264 P \u2264 .0007). A consistent pattern of increase in melanoma risk was also associated with increase in number of MC1R variants. The risk of melanoma associated with at least two MC1R variants was 2.6-fold higher than the risk associated with only one variant (odds ratio = 5.83 [95% confidence interval = 3.60 to 9.46] vs 2.25 [95% confidence interval = 1.44 to 3.52]; P(trend) = 1.86 \u00d7 10(-8)).

The shape of the Raman spectrum was very different from that of eumelanin. Four Raman bands were visible in the 500-2000 cm(-1) wavenumber region about 500, 1150, 1490 and 2000 cm(-1), which we assigned to the out-of-plane deformation and the stretching vibration of the phenyl rings, to the stretching vibration of C-N bonds or the stretching and wagging vibration of CH2, and to overtone or combination bands. Interestingly, we also show that the Raman spectrum of synthetic trichochrome F, a pigment that may be produced along with pheomelanin during pheomelanogenesis, is different from that of pheomelanin and similar to the spectrum of eumelanin. We could detect Raman signal of both eumelanin and pheomelanin in feathers and hairs where both pigments simultaneously occur without the need of isolating the pigment. This indicates that Raman spectroscopy represents a non-invasive method to detect pheomelanin and distinguish it from other pigments. This may be especially relevant to detect pheomelanin in animal skin including humans, where it has been associated with animal appearance and classification, human phototypes, prevention of skin diseases and cancer risk.","Authors":"Galv\u00e1n Ismael, Jorge Alberto, Solano Francisco, Wakamatsu Kazumasa","Journal":"Spectrochimica acta.

This study examined the association between serum PSA levels, which is a risk factor for prostate cancer, and variants in some melanoma-associated pigmentary genes. We studied participants, all aged 70+ years, in the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project who had no history of prostatitis or received treatment for prostate disease (n = 1033). We genotyped variants in MC1R (rs1805007, rs1805008), ASIP (rs4911414, rs1015362), SLC45A2 (rs28777, rs16891982), IRF4 (rs12203592), TYRP1 (rs1408799), TYR (rs1126809, rs1042602), SLC24A2 (rs12896399), and OCA2 (rs7495174). Generalised linear dominant models with Poisson distribution, log link functions and robust variance estimators estimated adjusted percentage differences (%PSA) in mean serum PSA levels (ng\/mL) between variant and wildtype (0%PSA = reference) genotypes, adjusting for age, body mass index, serum 25OHD levels and birth regions (Australia or New Zealand (ANZ), Europe or elsewhere). Serum PSA levels were strongly associated with advancing age and birth regions: mean PSA levels were lower in Europe-born (-29.7%) and elsewhere-born (-11.7%) men than ANZ-born men (reference). Lower %PSA was observed in men with variants in SLC45A2: rs28777 (-19.6;95%CI: -33.5, -2.7), rs16891982 (-17.3;95%CI:-30.4,-1.7) than in wildtype men (reference). There were significant interactions between birth regions and PSA levels in men with variants in MC1R (rs1805007; p-interaction = 0.0001) and ASIP (rs4911414; p-interaction = 0.007). For these genes %PSA was greater in ANZ-born men and lower in Europe- and elsewhere-born men with the variant than it was in wildtype men. In a post hoc analysis, serum testosterone levels were increased in men with MC1R rs1805007 and serum dihydrotestosterone in men with ASIP rs1015362. Men with SNPs in SLC45A2, who have less sun sensitive skin, have lower PSA levels. Men with SNPs in MC1R and ASIP, who have more sun sensitive skin, and were born in ANZ, have higher PSA levels. Androgens may modify these apparent associations of pigmentary genes and sun exposure with PSA levels. PSA levels and possibly prostate cancer risk may vary with sun sensitivity and sun exposure, the effects of which might be modified by androgen levels.","Authors":"Nair-Shalliker Visalini, Egger Sam, Chrzanowska Agata, Mason Rebecca, Waite Louise, Le Couteur David, Seibel Markus J, Handelsman David J, Cumming Robert, Smith David P, Armstrong Bruce K","Journal":"PloS one","Year":2018,"Keywords":"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Androgens, Australia, Dihydrotestosterone, Europe, Genes, Neoplasm, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Models, Genetic, Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, New Zealand, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms, Radiation Tolerance, Reference Values, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Sunlight, Testosterone","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29518100\/","Affiliations":"Cancer Research Division, Cancer Council New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Centre for Education and Research on Ageing, Concord Hospital and The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.","x":6.0797629356,"y":8.2607192993,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":29178624,"Title":"Clinical and genetic characteristics of xeroderma pigmentosum in Nepal.","Abstract":"Little is known about xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) in Himalayan countries.

These actions are mediated by the heptahelical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Gain-of-function mouse Mc1r alleles are associated with a dark, eumelanic coat. Conversely, loss-of-function variants, or overexpression of agouti, a natural melanocortin antagonist, yield yellow, pheomelanic furs. In humans, loss-of-function MC1R variants are associated with fair skin, poor tanning, propensity to freckle and increased skin cancer risk. Therefore, MC1R is a key regulator of mammalian pigmentation. Several observations such as induction of constitutive pigmentation in amelanotic mouse melanoma cells following expression of MC1R indicate that the receptor might display agonist-independent activity. We report a systematic and comparative study of MC1R and Mc1r constitutive activity. We show that expression of MC1R in heterologous systems leads to an agonist-independent increase in cyclic adenosine monophophate (cAMP). Basal signalling is a function of receptor expression and is two to fourfold higher for MC1R than for Mc1r. Moreover, it is observed in human melanoma cells over-expressing the MC1R. Constitutive signalling is abolished or reduced by point mutations of MC1R impairing the response to agonists, and is only doubled by the Lys94Glu mutation, mimicking the constitutively active mouse E(so-3J) allele. Stable or transient expression of wild-type MC1R, but not of loss-of-function mutants, potently stimulates forskolin activation of adenylyl cyclase, a common feature of constitutively active Gs-coupled receptors. Therefore, human MC1R displays a strong agonist-independent constitutive activity.","Authors":"S\u00e1nchez-M\u00e1s Jes\u00fas, Hahmann Christa, Gerritsen Ineke, Garc\u00eda-Borr\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 C, Jim\u00e9nez-Cervantes Celia","Journal":"Pigment cell research","Year":2004,"Keywords":"Adenylyl Cyclases, Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Tumor, Cyclic AMP, Female, Genetic Vectors, Humans, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Plasmids, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Transfection, Up-Regulation","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15250941\/","Affiliations":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, 30071 Espinardo, Spain.","x":4.3202981949,"y":8.9642591476,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":39491719,"Title":"The Risk Information and Skin-cancer Education for Undergraduate Prevention (RISE-UP) Study: Protocol for a Trial of Personalized Sun Protection Interventions for Skin Cancer Prevention among Undergraduate Students.","Abstract":"Addressing the increasing incidence of skin cancer among young adults is a priority.

This study was performed to investigate the relationships between MC1R gene polymorphisms and skin color in a large sample of French middle-aged Caucasian women. The codons 60 to 265 and the codon 294 of the MC1R gene were sequenced in 488 women. The skin color was measured on the inner side of the forearm using a spectrophotometric instrument. Fifteen variants were identified: Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Arg142His, Asp294His, Ile155Thr, Asp84Glu, Val60Leu, Val92Met, Arg163Gln, Ser83Pro, Thr95Met, Pro256Ser, Val265Ile, Ala166Ala and Gln233Gln. Women carrying Arg151Cys, Asp294His, Arg160Trp and Asp84Glu variants had a significantly higher reflectance in the red region, which indicates a lower level of functional melanin. This association was the most pronounced for women carrying Asp84Glu. In contrast, no significant difference was observed for other variants. Moreover, associations between MC1R polymorphisms and the risks of experiencing sunburn and of having freckles were found independently of skin color. Our findings support the hypothesis that MC1R polymorphisms do not necessarily alter the skin color but should sensitize the skin to UV-induced DNA damage.","Authors":"Latreille Julie, Ezzedine Khaled, Elfakir Anissa, Ambroisine Laurence, Gardinier Sophie, Galan Pilar, Hercberg Serge, Gruber Florian, Rees Jonathan, Tschachler Erwin, Guinot Christiane","Journal":"Photochemistry and photobiology","Year":2009,"Keywords":"Adult, Female, France, Hair Color, Humans, Phenotype, Photosensitivity Disorders, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Pigmentation, Spectrum Analysis, Sunlight, White People","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19656326\/","Affiliations":"CE.R.I.E.S.

Because mitochondrial DNA mutations are mainly caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and given that oxidative stress plays an important role in melanoma carcinogenesis, the investigation of DmtDNA4977 may be particularly relevant to the development of melanoma. In this study, we compared DmtDNA4977 levels in blood leukocytes from 206 melanoma patients and 219 healthy controls. Overall, melanoma cases had significantly higher levels of DmtDNA4977 than healthy controls (median: 0.60 vs 0.20, P = 0.008). The difference was evident among individuals who were older than 47 yrs, women, and had pigmentation risk factors (e.g., blond or red hair, blue eye, fair skin, light, or none tanning ability after prolonged sun exposure, and freckling in the sun as a child). The difference was also evident among those who had at least one lifetime sunburn with blistering and had no reported use of a sunlamp. Interestingly, among controls, DmtDNA4977 levels differed by phenotypic index and reported use of a sunlamp. In the risk assessment, increased levels of DmtDNA4977 were associated with a 1.23-fold increased risk of melanoma (odds ratio (OR): 1.23, 95% confidence interval (90% CI): 1.01, 1.50). A significant dose-response relationship was observed in quartile analysis (P = 0.001). In summary, our study suggests that high levels of DmtDNA4977 in blood leukocytes are associated with increased risk of melanoma and that association is affected by both pigmentation and personal history of sun exposure.","Authors":"Shen Jie, Wan Jie, Huff Chad, Fang Shenying, Lee Jeffrey E, Zhao Hua","Journal":"Pigment cell & melanoma research","Year":2016,"Keywords":"Base Pairing, Case-Control Studies, DNA, Mitochondrial, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Leukocytes, Male, Melanoma, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Phenotype, Risk Factors, Sequence Deletion","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/26988264\/","Affiliations":"Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.","x":6.612944603,"y":9.1012506485,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":19338054,"Title":"Identification and functional analysis of novel variants of the human melanocortin 1 receptor found in melanoma patients.","Abstract":"The melanocortin 1 receptor, a Gs protein-coupled receptor expressed in epidermal melanocytes, is a major determinant of skin pigmentation and phototype and an important contributor to melanoma risk.

During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 642 (1.5%) participants developed melanoma (253 invasive, 389 in situ). The characteristics most strongly associated with invasive melanoma were self-reported nevus density at age 21 years (many vs. no moles hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]\u00a0= 4.91 [2.81-8.55]), inability to tan (no tan vs. deep tan, hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]\u00a0= 3.39 [1.85-6.20]), and red hair color (vs. black, hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]\u00a0= 3.11 [1.50-6.43]). Propensity to sunburn was not associated with melanoma after tanning inability was adjusted for. People with both high nevus density and a history of multiple keratinocyte cancers had significantly higher melanoma risks than those with only one of those traits.

Moreover, T157 was phosphorylated in wild-type MC1R and a T157D mutation mimicking constitutive phosphorylation allowed normal traffic, and rescued the retention phenotype of R160W and R162P. Therefore, MC1R export is likely regulated by T157 phosphorylation and the (160)RARR(163) arginine-based motif functions as an ER retrieval signal.

Here, we ran the preregistered study on a population of 4,117 subjects who took part in an anonymous electronic survey.

It also positively correlated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, most strongly with learning disabilities disorder and phobic disorder in men and general anxiety disorder in women. However, most of these associations disappeared when the darkness of skin was included in the models, suggesting that skin fairness, not hair redness, is responsible for the associations. We discussed two possible explanations for the observed pattern, the first based on vitamin D deficiency due to the avoidance of sunbathing by subjects with sensitive skin, including some redheads, and second based on folic acid depletion in fair skinned subjects, again including some (a different subpopulation of) redheads. It must be emphasized, however, that both of these explanations are only hypothetical as no data on the concentration of vitamin D or folic acid are available for our subjects.

The possibility that altered cellular localization of the R151C and R160W variant receptors could underlie their association with RHC was therefore considered.

We found that the human melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and its mouse ortholog (Mc1r) undergo homologous desensitization in melanoma cells. Desensitization is not dependent on protein kinase A, protein kinase C, calcium mobilization, or MAPKs, but is agonist dose-dependent. Both melanoma cells and normal melanocytes express two members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, GRK2 and GRK6. Cotransfection of the receptor and GRK2 or GRK6 genes in heterologous cells demonstrated that GRK2 and GRK6 impair agonist-dependent signaling by MC1R or Mc1r.

Controls were identified through New Hampshire driver's license lists and frequency-matched by age and gender to cases. We interviewed 423 eligible cases and 678 eligible controls. Host characteristics, including mole counts, were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Our results showed that pigmentary factors, including eye color (OR = 1.57 for blue eyes compared to brown), hair color (OR = 1.85 for blonde\/red hair color compared to brown\/black), freckles before age 15 (OR = 2.39 for freckles present compared to absent) and sun sensitivity (OR = 2.25 for peeling sunburn followed by no tan or a light tan and 2.42 for sunburn followed by tan compared to tanning immediately), were related to melanoma risk; these associations held after adjustment for sun-related factors and for moles. In analyses confined to skin examination participants, the covariate-adjusted effects of benign and atypical moles were moderately strong. Compared to 0-4 benign moles, risk increased steadily for 5-14 moles (OR = 1.71), 15-24 moles (OR = 3.55) and >or= 25 moles (OR = 4.33). Risk also increased with the number of atypical moles; compared to none, the ORs for having 1, 2-3, or >or= 4 atypical moles were 2.08, 1.84 and 3.80, respectively. Although risk was highest for those with multiple benign and atypical moles, the interaction was not of statistical significance. Our findings, arising from the first population- and incidence-based study to evaluate atypical moles in relation to melanoma risk, confirm the importance of host susceptibility, represented by pigmentary factors and the tendency to develop benign or atypical moles, in the etiology of this disease.","Authors":"Titus-Ernstoff Linda, Perry Ann E, Spencer Steven K, Gibson Jennifer J, Cole Bernard F, Ernstoff Marc S","Journal":"International journal of cancer","Year":2005,"Keywords":"Adult, Case-Control Studies, Eye Color, Female, Hair Color, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Middle Aged, Nevus, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Sunburn","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15761869\/","Affiliations":"Department of Community and Family Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA. linda.titus-ernstoff@dartmouth.edu","x":8.3850135803,"y":8.0541915894,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":30401788,"Title":"Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH.","Abstract":"The production of melanin increases skin pigmentation and reduces the risk of skin cancer.

We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on pH and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor.

The authors studied healthy women with bright red (n = 10) or dark (n = 10) hair. Blood was sampled for subsequent analyses of melanocortin-1 receptor alleles. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane randomly set at an end-tidal concentration between 5.5 and 7.5%. After an equilibration period, a noxious electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 70 mA) was transmitted through bilateral intradermal needles. If the volunteer moved in response to stimulation, desflurane was increased by 0.5%; otherwise, it was decreased by 0.5%. This was continued until volunteers \"crossed over\" from movement to nonmovement (or vice versa) four times. Individual logistic regression curves were used to determine desflurane requirement (P50). Desflurane requirements in the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-sample test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The desflurane requirement in redheads (6.2 vol% [95% CI, 5.9-6.5]) was significantly greater than in dark-haired women (5.2 vol% [4.9-5.5]; P = 0.0004). Nine of 10 redheads were either homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations on the melanocortin-1 receptor gene.

We used self-reported data from a population-based study of twins in California, assessing the prevalence of large nevi, lifetime usual sun exposure behavior and sunburn experience, skin type and color, and birthplace and recent domicile, for which we obtained estimates of potential sun exposure. Among constitutional variables, skin type (burn rather than tan) and having blond (but not red) hair color were associated with having more than three large nevi, as was Celtic ancestry. Spending more time in the sun in adulthood was inversely associated with number of large nevi, whereas spending time in the sun during weekends in childhood increased the risk of having large nevi. We observed no latitude gradient in nevi prevalence, except among those of Mediterranean ancestry (those in the South were more likely than those in the North to report large nevi). The prevalence of large nevi was most readily explained by constitutional and then by behavioral variables in this study, rather than by independent variables describing an individual's opportunity for sun exposure. There seem to be independent relationships between nevi frequency and other melanoma risk factors, with the notable exceptions of skin color and red hair phenotype: implying that if these risk factors represent a genetic propensity to develop melanoma, that risk would seem to be unrelated to the development of nevi.","Authors":"Cockburn Myles, Hamilton Ann, Mack Thomas","Journal":"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","Year":2007,"Keywords":"Adolescent, Adult, California, Environmental Exposure, Female, Geography, Hair Color, Health Behavior, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Melanoma, Middle Aged, Nevus, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Self-Examination, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Sunburn, Sunlight, Surveys and Questionnaires","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17267390\/","Affiliations":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089-9175, USA. cockburn@usc.edu","x":8.4887170792,"y":8.3774785995,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":17130136,"Title":"Regulation of human melanocortin 1 receptor signaling and trafficking by Thr-308 and Ser-316 and its alteration in variant alleles associated with red hair and skin cancer.","Abstract":"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, is a key regulator of melanocyte proliferation and differentiation and a determinant of pigmentation, skin phototype, and skin cancer risk. MC1R activation stimulates melanogenesis and increases the ratio of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanins to yellowish and poorly photoprotective pheomelanin pigments. Desensitization and internalization are key regulatory mechanisms of GPCR signaling. Agonist-induced desensitization usually depends on phosphorylation by a GPCR kinase (GRK) followed by receptor internalization in endocytic vesicles. We have shown that MC1R desensitization is mediated by two GRKs expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells, GRK2 and GRK6. Here we show that in contrast with this dual specificity for desensitization, GRK6 but not GRK2 mediated MC1R internalization. Mutagenesis studies suggested that the targets of GRK6 are two residues located in the MC1R cytosolic C terminus, Thr-308 and Ser-316. A T308D\/S316D mutant mimicking their phosphorylated state was constitutively desensitized and associated with endosomes, whereas a T308A\/S316A mutant was resistant to desensitization and internalization. We studied the desensitization and internalization of three variant MC1R forms associated with red hair and increased skin cancer risk: R151C, R160W, and D294H. These variants showed a less efficient desensitization. Moreover, D294H was resistant to internalization, thus accounting for its abnormally high surface expression. Co-expression of variant and wild type MC1R modified its desensitization and internalization behavior. These data suggest that MC1R might be regulated by novel mechanisms including differential effects of GRKs and altered desensitization rates of certain allelic combinations.","Authors":"S\u00e1nchez-Laorden Berta L, Jim\u00e9nez-Cervantes Celia, Garc\u00eda-Borr\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 C","Journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","Year":2007,"Keywords":"Amino Acid Sequence, Cell Line, Cyclic AMP, Genetic Variation, Hair Color, Humans, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Protein Conformation, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Recombinant Proteins, Serine, Signal Transduction, Skin Neoplasms, Threonine, Transfection","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17130136\/","Affiliations":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, 30100 Espinardo, Spain.","x":4.6268987656,"y":10.2691688538,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":17068478,"Title":"Risk factors for histological types and anatomic sites of cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma: an italian case-control study.","Abstract":"Different clinico-pathologic subtypes and anatomic sites of basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) may display distinct characteristics and mechanisms of development.

A variety of antioxidant enzymes, including the polymorphic glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, protect the cell from UVR-induced oxidative challenge. GSTM1 and GSTT1 are deleted in approximately 50 and 20% of the Caucasian population, respectively, and GST null genotype has been associated with increased sunburn sensitivity and reduced minimal erythemal dose (MED) after broadband UVR exposure in healthy volunteers and with susceptibility to skin cancer. Another polymorphic determinant of UVR sensitivity is the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), which protects cells from UVR-induced apoptosis and photodamage. Our aim was therefore to investigate whether GST or MC1R genotype influenced erythemal sensitivity to narrow band (TL-01) ultraviolet B radiation phototherapy in patients with psoriasis. We used TaqMan quantitative gene copy and allelic discrimination assays to determine GST and MC1R genotypes, and looked for possible associations between genotype and threshold erythemal sensitivity (MED) and treatment outcomes in patients with psoriasis (n=256).

We identified keratinocyte growth factor (Kgf) as a forskolin-induced fibroblast-derived cytokine that promoted keratinocyte proliferation, as forskolin induced Kgf expression both in the skin and in primary fibroblasts. Lastly, we found that even in the absence of pigmentation, forskolin-induced epidermal thickening significantly diminished the amount of UV-A and UV-B that passed through whole skin and reduced the amount of UV-B-associated epidermal sunburn cells.

Yet, irradiating melanin in vitro or in cultured cells also generates active oxygen species such as superoxide, which can indirectly induce oxidative base lesions and DNA strand breaks. This photosensitization is greater for pheomelanin (yellow and red melanin) than for eumelanin (brown and black). The in vivo photosensitizing ability of melanin is unknown. We used congenic mice of black, yellow, and albino coat colors to investigate the induction of DNA lesions and apoptosis after exposure to predominantly UVB (280-320 nm) or UVA (320-400 nm) radiation. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers induced by direct UVB absorption were equal in all three strains, as was apoptosis measured as sunburn cells or as keratinocytes containing active caspase-3. However, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were approximately 3-fold more frequent in black and yellow mice after UVB or UVA irradiation than in albino. In epidermal sheets, TUNEL-positive cells lined the upper portion of the hair follicle, consistent with UV-induced photosensitization by melanin in the hair shaft. Because the concentration of eumelanin in black mice was three times that of pheomelanin in yellow mice, pheomelanin had 3-fold greater specific activity. We conclude that UV-irradiated melanin, particularly pheomelanin, photosensitizes adjacent cells to caspase-3 independent apoptosis, and this occurs at a frequency greater than the apoptosis induced by direct DNA absorption of UV. Melanin-induced apoptosis may contribute to the increased sensitivity of individuals with blonde and red hair to sunburn and skin cancer.","Authors":"Takeuchi Seiji, Zhang Wengeng, Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Ito Shosuke, Hearing Vincent J, Kraemer Kenneth H, Brash Douglas E","Journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Year":2004,"Keywords":"Animals, Apoptosis, Caspase 3, Caspases, DNA Damage, Female, Hair Color, Humans, In Situ Nick-End Labeling, Melanins, Mice, Mice, Congenic, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Photosensitizing Agents, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Ultraviolet Rays","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15477596\/","Affiliations":"Departments of Therapeutic Radiology, Genetics, and Dermatology, and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8040, USA.","x":5.8393702507,"y":10.4202728271,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":19682281,"Title":"Stem cell factor rescues tyrosinase expression and pigmentation in discreet anatomic locations in albino mice.","Abstract":"The K14-SCF transgenic murine model of variant pigmentation is based on epidermal expression of stem cell factor (SCF) on the C57BL\/6J background.

Here, we extend this animal model by developing a compound mutant transgenic amelanotic animal defective at both the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) and tyrosinase (Tyr) loci.

Furthermore, K14-SCF Tyr(c2j\/c2j) animals demonstrated tyrosinase expression and enzymatic activity, suggesting that the c2j Tyr defect can be rescued in part by SCF in the ears and tail. Lastly, UV sensitivity of K14-Scf congenic animals depended mainly on the amount of eumelanin present in the skin.

As red hair has been associated with unique mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), we tested the hypothesis that local anesthetic onset and duration of action were significantly modified in red haired individuals as related to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype. Ninety-two participants between the ages of 18 and 65 years were enrolled and assigned to one of four experimental groups: lidocaine-redhead, lidocaine-brunette hair, bupivacaine-redhead, and bupivacaine-brunette hair. Onset and duration of action were quantified in response to sharp sensation. Sputum samples were collected, gDNA was extracted and subjected to the Illumina CoreExome-24 SNP array (Illumina, San Diego, California). Twenty-five MC1R sequence polymorphisms were analyzed. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to examine treatment and hair color effects, and their interaction on onset and duration time respectively; P \u2264 .05 was considered statistically significant. Overall mean onset of action was statistically significant (P = .042) when comparing red hair to brunette responses between anesthesia (lidocaine versus bupivacaine: 2.68 \u00b1 0.28 minutes versus 3.60 \u00b1 0.30 minutes, and 4.46 \u00b1 0.49 minutes versus 5.14 \u00b1 0.46 minutes, respectively).

There were no statistical interactions between treatment and hair color on either onset or duration (P = .761 and P = .120, respectively).

Of 25 SNPs from MC1R assayed from the Illumina CoreExome-24 array, two missense mutations at loci rs1805007 (R151C) and rs1805008 (R160W) significantly predicted phenotypic responses to local analgesics.

To our knowledge there are no published studies that associate the effect of hair color with local anesthetic function on onset and duration of action via SNP genotyping. The SNP genotyping reaffirmed functional results, and points to the complimentary impact that precision medicine will have on clinical decision making and patient comfort with future studies to unravel the degree to which SNPs affect these responses.","Authors":"Dalman Mark, Blazer Marie Mantini, Petrozzi Rocco, Pallas Bria, Huynh Sophia, Alden Cham, Menaria Tulsi, Lin Junrui, Pixton Alex, Nagajothi Naagashiv","Journal":"Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association","Year":2025,"Keywords":"Humans, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Anesthetics, Local, Adult, Female, Male, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Middle Aged, Lidocaine, Genotype, Young Adult, Hair Color, Bupivacaine, Adolescent, Aged, Time Factors","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40126997\/","Affiliations":"*Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine, Independence, OH.

We assessed potential risk factors for basal cell carcinoma in a population from southern Europe. This multicenter case-control study involved 528 newly diagnosed cases and 512 controls. In the multivariate analysis, red hair, lighter colored eyes, high nevus counts on the upper limbs, and the presence of solar lentigines and actinic keratoses were all associated with basal cell carcinoma. The risk of the tumor increased in subjects who reported burning easily and experiencing sunburn episodes before 15 years of age. An association was documented with indices of recreational sun exposure but no clear evidence of exposure-effect relationship was found. No relation was found with occupational sun exposure. Finally, basal cell carcinoma appeared to be significantly associated with a family history of skin tumors, a personal history of tumors other than those on skin, and radiotherapy. Genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in the onset of basal cell carcinoma.","Authors":"Naldi L, DiLandro A, D'Avanzo B, Parazzini F","Journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","Year":2000,"Keywords":"Adult, Aged, Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Case-Control Studies, Environmental Exposure, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Italy, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Surveys and Questionnaires","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/10688715\/","Affiliations":"Laboratorio di Epidemiologia Generale, Istituto di Recerche Farmacologiche M.

Melanocyte cultures originating from individuals with light and dark skin types were grown in media with varying concentration of L-tyrosine. Melanosomal melanin content and the size of the organelles were measured after subcellular fractionation. In light-skin type cells, increased melanin production resulted in a more elliptical shape of melanosomes. In melanosomes that constitutively produce more melanin, the tyrosine-induced melanogenesis caused enlargement in all dimensions. X-ray microanalysis provided evidence that the increase in sulfur content induced by high tyrosine concentration was more prominent in the melanosomes from light skin types. A ratio between pheomelanin and eumelanin found in light-skin type melanosomes by HPLC was increased more markedly than that in melanosomes from dark skin melanocytes. These findings suggest that the melanocytes of light-skinned individuals exhibit a preference for pheomelanogenesis. Pheomelanin production is a thiol-consuming process and that might increase the risk of oxidation stress in these cells. This fact, together with the limited ability of pheomelanin to absorb UV radiation may lead to an elevated skin cancer risk among light-skinned individuals.","Authors":"van Nieuwpoort Frans, Smit Nico P M, Kolb Ria, van der Meulen Hans, Koerten Henk, Pavel Stan","Journal":"The Journal of investigative dermatology","Year":2004,"Keywords":"Cells, Cultured, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Culture Media, Epidermal Cells, Epidermis, Humans, Melanins, Melanosomes, Skin Pigmentation, Sulfur, Tyrosine","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15140229\/","Affiliations":"Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. s.pavel@lumc.nl","x":5.3884310722,"y":10.4777421951,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":20548316,"Title":"Vexed by red-headed conundrums.","Abstract":"Reduced function alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) lead to red hair, freckling, and sun sensitivity.

Information on various risk factors for malignant melanoma was collected through mailed questionnaires sent to a random sample of the Icelandic population. The information collected was the first phase of a prospective study on malignant melanoma among aircrew members as compared to a population sample. The overall participation rate was about 50%. Seven percent of women and six percent of men had red hair color. Blue or green eye color was reported among 89% of women and 87% of men. Sixteen percent of women aged 20 to 39 had used sun beds more than 100 times during their lifetime, while the corresponding figure was 12% for men of the same age. Younger age groups had more sunny vacations than the older age groups. The frequency of sunburn differed in the groups with reported different skin types according to Fitzpatrick classification. The high prevalence of sun bed usage among young women is concurrent with the increased incidence of malignant melanoma among young women registered in the nationwide cancer registry. Young people have more often used sun beds and taken sunny vacation than the older, indicating a changed behavior in the population.","Authors":"Rafnsson Vilhjalmur, Hrafnkelsson Jon, Tulinius Hrafn, Sigurgeirsson Bardur, Olafsson Jon H","Journal":"Preventive medicine","Year":2004,"Keywords":"Adult, Environmental Exposure, Female, Humans, Iceland, Incidence, Male, Melanoma, Prevalence, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Sunlight, Surveys and Questionnaires, Time Factors","URL":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15226032\/","Affiliations":"Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland. vilraf@hi.is","x":8.7541790009,"y":8.4893102646,"cluster":-1},{"PMID":18539553,"Title":"Prenatal manifestation in a family affected by nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","Abstract":"We report here a three generations family with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) in which the diagnosis was made only after a second trimester of pregnancy ultrasonography revealing fetal cranio-cerebral malformations.
